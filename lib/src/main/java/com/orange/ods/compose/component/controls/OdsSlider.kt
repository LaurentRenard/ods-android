/**
 * <a href="https://system.design.orange.com/0c1af118d/p/14638a-selection-controls/b/352c00" class="external" target="_blank">ODS slider</a>.
 *
 * Sliders allow users to make selections from a range of values.
 *
 * Sliders reflect a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value.
 * They are ideal for adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, or applying image filters.
 *
 * Use continuous sliders to allow users to make meaningful selections that donâ€™t
 * require a specific value.
 *
 * You can allow the user to choose only between predefined set of values by specifying the amount
 * of steps between min and max values.
 *
 * @param value current value of the Slider. If outside of [valueRange] provided, value will be
 * coerced to this range.
 * @param onValueChange lambda in which value should be updated
 * @param modifier modifiers for the Slider layout
 * @param enabled whether or not component is enabled and can be interacted with or not
 * @param valueRange range of values that Slider value can take. Passed [value] will be coerced to
 * this range
 * @param steps if greater than 0, specifies the amounts of discrete values, evenly distributed
 * between across the whole value range. If 0, slider will behave as a continuous slider and allow
 * to choose any value from the range specified. Must not be negative.
 * @param onValueChangeFinished lambda to be invoked when value change has ended. This callback
 * shouldn't be used to update the slider value (use [onValueChange] for that), but rather to
 * know when the user has completed selecting a new value by ending a drag or a click.
 * @param interactionSource the [MutableInteractionSource] representing the stream of
 * [Interaction]s for this Slider. You can create and pass in your own remembered
 * [MutableInteractionSource] if you want to observe [Interaction]s and customize the
 * appearance / behavior of this Slider in different [Interaction]s.
