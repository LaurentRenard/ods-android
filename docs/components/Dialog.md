# Dialogs

Dialogs inform users about a task and can contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks.

A dialog is a type of modal window that appears in front of app content to
provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app
functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed,
or a required action has been taken.

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

## Using dialogs

Before you can use Orange themed dialogs, you need to add a dependency to the Orange Design System
for Android library. For more information, go to the
[Getting started](../getting-started.md) page.

### Material Design

Orange Dialogs are based on Material Design from Google and apply Orange theming.
**Note:** Here is the full documentation
of [Material Design Dialog](https://material.io/components/dialogs/)

### Accessibility

The contents within a dialog should follow their own accessibility guidelines,
such as an icon on a title having a content description via the
`android:contentDescription` attribute set in the
`MaterialAlertDialog.MaterialComponents.Title.Icon` style or descendant.

### Types

There are three types of dialogs: 
-   [Alert dialog](#alert-dialog)
-   [Simple dialog](#simple-dialog)

## Alert dialog

Alert dialogs interrupt users with urgent information, details, or actions.

In code:

```kt
MaterialAlertDialogBuilder(context)
        .setTitle(resources.getString(R.string.title))
        .setMessage(resources.getString(R.string.supporting_text))
        .setNeutralButton(resources.getString(R.string.cancel)) { dialog, which ->
            // Respond to neutral button press
        }
        .setNegativeButton(resources.getString(R.string.decline)) { dialog, which ->
            // Respond to negative button press
        }
        .setPositiveButton(resources.getString(R.string.accept)) { dialog, which ->
            // Respond to positive button press
        }
        .show()
```

## Simple dialog

Simple dialogs can display items that are immediately actionable when selected.
They donâ€™t have text buttons.

As simple dialogs are interruptive, they should be used sparingly.
Alternatively, dropdown menus provide options in a non-modal, less disruptive
way.

In code:

```kt
val items = arrayOf("Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3")

MaterialAlertDialogBuilder(context)
        .setTitle(resources.getString(R.string.title))
        .setItems(items) { dialog, which ->
             // Respond to item chosen
         }
        .show()
```

## Centered dialog

```kt
MaterialAlertDialogBuilder(context, R.style.Widget.Orange.Dialog.Centered)
        .setTitle("title")
        .setMessage("message")
        .setPositiveButton("positiveText", null)
        .setNegativeButton("negativeText", null)
        .setIcon(R.drawable.your_drawable)
        .show()
```
