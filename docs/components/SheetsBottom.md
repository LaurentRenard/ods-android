The contents within a bottom sheet should follow their own accessibility guidelines, such as images having content descriptions set on them.

### Jetpack Compose

```kotlin
OdsBottomSheetScaffold(
    sheetContent = {
        // Put here the content of the sheet
    },
    modifier = Modifier,
    scaffoldState = rememberBottomSheetScaffoldState(),
    topBar = null,
    snackbarHost = {},
    floatingActionButton = {},
    floatingActionButtonPosition = FabPosition.End,
    sheetGesturesEnabled = true,
    sheetPeekHeight = 56.dp,
    content = {
        // Put here the screen content
    }
)
```
